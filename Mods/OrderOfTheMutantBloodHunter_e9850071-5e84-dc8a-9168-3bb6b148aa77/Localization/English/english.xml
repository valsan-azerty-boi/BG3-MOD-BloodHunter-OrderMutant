  <content contentuid="h4e81236cg1ce4gcaceg366cg4b9226b3bc1f" version="1">Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood even further. Calling themselves the Order of the Mutant, these blood hunters now specialize in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their foes, altering their biology to be best prepared for any conflict.</content>

  <content contentuid="hfd39bc80g4afbg218dg68ffgb0cc9d3158fe" version="1">You learn forbidden alchemical formulas—known as mutagens—that can temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities. As a bonus action, you consume a mutagen, whose effects and side effects last until you finish a long rest unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush all mutagens from your system, ending their effects and side effects. Mutagens are designed for the specific biology of the character who concocted them, and your mutagens have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next long rest.</content>

Additionally, you can trigger a burst of adrenaline that lets you temporarily resist the negative effects of a mutagen. As a bonus action, you can ignore the negative side effect of one mutagen affecting you for some time. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</content>

Whenever a branded creature attempts to alter its form, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the attempt fail, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn.</content>
